            <h2>Iris Hung</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
              Iris Hung began studying piano at the age of five, after learning “Hot Cross Buns” (for two fingers)
              from her older sister. Since then, she has learned to use all her fingers and greatly expanded her
              repertoire, performing as a soloist and chamber musician across Canada and in the United States and
              Austria. Iris made her orchestral debut with the Victoria Conservatory of Music Orchestra and Pacific
              Opera conductor Timothy Vernon, performing Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 17. She received her Bachelor of
              Music in Piano Performance (with distinction) from the University of Victoria on a full tuition
              scholarship and her Master of Music in Piano Performance and Pedagogy from the University of Toronto.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and raised in the suburban woods of Coquitlam, British Columbia, Iris received many awards at local
              festivals and competitions, as well as recognition for piano, theory, and history exams. At the age of
              seven, she won her first Provincial Medal of Excellence from Conservatory Canada (awarded for the
              highest exam mark for grade one) and later won the National Medal of Excellence for grades 9 and 10
              piano. While studying at the University of Victoria, under the dedicated care and expertise of Professor
              May Ling Kwok, Iris competed at the highest level at the BC Provincial Festival, for Senior and National
              Piano. In March 2018, as a winner of the University of Victoria Concerto Competition, Iris performed
              Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G major with the UVic Orchestra.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coupled with her love for travel and exploring, Iris has participated in summer programs at the
              Universität Mozarteum in Salzburg, the Adamant Music School in Vermont, and many others, and premiered
              new works and performed for underserved communities. While in Victoria and Austria, Iris delved into her
              lifelong love for Baroque music and historically informed performance, studying briefly with
              harpsichordist Colin Tilney, Steven Devine, and Florian Birsak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iris believes that making music is a powerful act of self-discovery and expression, and strives to
              instill a high level of integrity and a deep love for music in her students. With nearly a decade of
              teaching experience, Iris has nurtured students of all ages, levels, and abilities, from beginners as
              young as three years old, to undergraduate piano majors, many of whom received honours at local
              festivals and distinction for Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) exams. While at U of T, Iris studied the
              effectiveness of mind-body teaching methods, including Alexander Technique, on advanced pianists, and
              more recently, developed multi-modal listening activities for young piano students, drawing inspiration
              from the pedagogical schools of Kodaly, Dalcroze, Orff, and Yamaha. Recently, Iris began studies on
              Dispokenesis and neurophysiology in musician performance, health, and learning.

        <div class="overlay  overlayBottom">
          <div class="text">
            <h2>David Sullivan</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
              David is a classical pianist with a strong interest in free improvisation. He graduated from York
              University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Specialist in Music. While at York University he not only
              continued his journey as a classical pianist but began his journey as an improviser, under the direction
              of educators Professor Casey Sokol and Matthew Brubeck.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020 David graduated from the University of Toronto with a Master of Music in Piano Pedagogy and
              Performance under the instruction of Professor Midori Koga. There he learned the importance of listening
              and reacting, both when performing and when teaching. The difference between a novice pianist and a
              professional pianist in part is their ability to listen to the piano and change their touch accordingly;
              similarly, the difference between a good teacher and great teacher is their ability to listen and observe
              students and change their teaching approach to match each particular student.
            </p>
            <p>
              When teaching piano, it is essential to David that his students feel comfortable expressing themselves in
              the lesson. He believes that students learn best when they can comfortably share their thoughts, ask
              questions, participate in one-on-one discussions, and try new things; therefore, as a teacher, It is
              David’s goal to actively ensure his students have these advantages. By identifying how each individual
              student learns best, how they are motivated, and what they appreciate most in music David customizes
              lessons to suit the needs, interests, and learning styles of each individual student. He sees each and
              every student as a unique case and works to develop a lesson plan that suits their particular needs.
